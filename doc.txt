Sure, here are four natural resources found in Ghana and their economic benefits:

1. **Gold**: Ghana is one of the largest producers of gold in Africa. The mining of gold contributes significantly to Ghana's economy through revenue generation, job creation, and foreign exchange earnings. Gold exports contribute to Ghana's GDP and help stabilize the country's currency.

2. **Cocoa**: Ghana is the second-largest producer of cocoa globally. Cocoa production provides employment opportunities for millions of Ghanaians, particularly in rural areas. Cocoa exports generate substantial revenue for the country and contribute to foreign exchange earnings, supporting economic growth and development.

3. **Oil**: The discovery of oil in Ghana's offshore reserves has boosted the country's economy. Oil production contributes to government revenue through taxes and royalties, enhances export earnings, and attracts foreign investment. Additionally, oil revenues support infrastructure development and social programs, driving economic growth and poverty reduction.

4. **Timber**: Ghana has abundant timber resources, including tropical hardwoods like mahogany and teak. Timber extraction and processing support the economy by providing employment and generating revenue through exports. However, sustainable management practices are crucial to prevent deforestation and ensure the long-term viability of Ghana's timber industry.

These natural resources play vital roles in Ghana's economy, contributing to revenue generation, employment, export earnings, and overall economic development. However, sustainable management practices are essential to ensure their long-term viability and minimize environmental degradation.
